# Pitch 

As of today, in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and it's restrictions, people has lost the "old times" common knowledge of entertainment and party places. Many of them had closed, new have appeared, capacity restrictions and therefore, "queue" status or tickets availability and many other conditions have made difficult the task of finding and assisting entertainment events.

- There's the need for a centralized "place" where to:
-  From a _producers_ position, publish events and sell tickets for it. 
- For the _assistant_ position, The need for finding this entertainment places/opportunities, know its conditions and status and buy and secure tickets.
