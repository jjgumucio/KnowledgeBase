# Crowdlytics pitch
Small and medium businesses in general, donÂ´t apply data analysis at all and neither on a daily basis. The reason for this is mainly cause of lack of resources (money, time, HR, etc).
The reality is that data analysis is really useful and valuable for business of every size.

### Solution:
- Create common, community driven big data  _repository_ with data collected from as many small and medium business as possible.
- The data submitted should be organized and classified to easily access subsets of data given a certain business model, category or area of performance.
- SMBs inject their business data to this _repository_ and, in return, they get access to all data of the _repository_, or some subset of it attractive to their business.

### Business model:
- SMBs can voluntarily inject their data into the central _repository_ and gain access to all data with the condition that the ownership of the data is transferred to __Crowdlytics__.
