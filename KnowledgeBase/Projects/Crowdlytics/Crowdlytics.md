# Crowdlytics pitch
Small and medium businesses in general, donÂ´t apply data analysis at all and neither on a daily basis. The reason for this is mainly cause of lack of resources (money, time, HR, etc).
The reality is that data analysis is really useful and valuable for business of every size.

### Solution:
- Create common, community driven big data  _repository_ with data collected from as many small and medium business as possible.
- SMBs inject their business data to this _repository_ and, in return, they get access to all data of the repo (annonimized)
